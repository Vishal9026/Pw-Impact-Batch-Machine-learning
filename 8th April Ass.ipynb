    "In regression problems, Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are common evaluation metrics. They measure the average squared difference between the predicted values and the actual values.\n",

This is particularly important because the goal is to predict house prices accurately, and RMSE provides an intuitive understanding of how well the model is performing in that respect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another useful metric for regression problems is R-squared, which measures the proportion of the variance in the target variable that is explained by the model. However, in the case of SVM regression, where the model is optimized for minimizing the error, RMSE is more commonly used."

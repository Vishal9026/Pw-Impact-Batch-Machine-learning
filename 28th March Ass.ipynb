    "Ridge regression is a model tuning method that is used to analyse any data that suffers from multicollinearity. This method performs L2 regularization. When the issue of multicollinearity occurs, least-squares are unbiased, and variances are large, this results in predicted values being far away from the actual values. "

    "The Ridge Regression algorithm differs from OLS regression in that it adds a penalty term to the sum of squared residuals. This penalty term shrinks the coefficients towards zero, and as a result, Ridge Regression produces less variance and more bias than OLS regression. Ridge Regression is often used when there is multicollinearity among the independent variables, which means that the independent variables are highly correlated with each other. In such situations, OLS regression can produce unstable estimates of the coefficients, while Ridge Regression can help to stabilize the estimates."

    "This is one of the most popular methods for selecting the value of λ in Ridge Regression. In cross-validation, the dataset is divided into k-folds, and the model is trained on k-1 folds and tested on the remaining fold. This process is repeated for each fold, and the average validation error is computed for each value of λ. The value of λ that gives the lowest validation error is selected.\n",
    "### Analytic approach: \n",
    "An analytical approach can be used to derive an optimal value of λ. This approach involves finding the value of λ that minimizes the mean squared error of the Ridge Regression model. This approach requires some mathematical manipulation and is often used in situations where the dataset is not too large.\n",

    "An empirical rule suggests that the value of λ can be chosen as a fraction of the standard deviation of the coefficients of the OLS regression. For example, a value of λ equal to 0.1 times the standard deviation of the coefficients can be used. This method is less reliable than the other two methods but can be useful in situations where computational resources are limited."

    "In Ridge Regression, the coefficients (also known as weights or parameters) are estimated by minimizing a cost function that includes a regularization penalty. The interpretation of the coefficients in Ridge Regression is similar to that in ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, but with some important differences due to the presence of the regularization penalty.\n",

    "Secondly, the coefficients in Ridge Regression reflect the change in the response variable for a one-unit change in the predictor variable, holding all other predictors constant.

This is because Ridge Regression shrinks the coefficients towards zero to reduce their variance and prevent overfitting.\n",

    "Ridge Regression is a type of linear regression that is used to handle multicollinearity (i.e., when predictor variables are correlated with each other) in the data. It works by adding a penalty term to the standard linear regression equation, which constrains the size of the coefficients of the predictor variables. This can help prevent overfitting and improve the stability of the model.\n",

You would typically use a sliding window approach, where you train the model on a subset of the data and then use it to make predictions for the next time step. You can then evaluate the performance of the model by comparing its predictions to the actual values in the test set.\n",

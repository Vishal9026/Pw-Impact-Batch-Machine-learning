    "1-In terms of handling bias, Elastic Net is considered better than Ridge and Lasso regression, Small bias leads to the disturbance of prediction as it is dependent on a variable. Therefore Elastic Net is better in handling collinearity than the combined ridge and lasso regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "2-Also, When it comes to complexity, again, Elastic Net performs better than ridge and lasso regression as both ridge and lasso, the number of variables is not significantly reduced. Here, incapability of reducing variables causes declination in model accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "3-Ridge and Elastic Net could be considered better than the Lasso Regression as Lasso regression predictors do not perform as accurately as Ridge and Elastic Net. Lasso Regression tends to pick non-zero as predictors and sometimes it affects accuracy when relevant predictors are considered as non zero. "

    "#### Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Selection: Elastic Net Regression can perform feature selection by shrinking the coefficients of less important variables to zero, resulting in a more interpretable and efficient model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handles multicollinearity: Elastic Net Regression can handle multicollinearity, which occurs when predictor variables are highly correlated with each other, by shrinking the coefficients of highly correlated variables.\n",

    "Works well with high-dimensional data: Elastic Net Regression is particularly useful when working with high-dimensional data where the number of predictors is much larger than the number of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility: Elastic Net Regression offers a balance between the L1 and L2 regularization methods, which makes it more flexible than the individual regularization methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational Intensity: Elastic Net Regression can be computationally intensive, especially when dealing with large datasets, due to the cross-validation and grid search process required to select the optimal regularization parameters.\n",

    "Complete Case Analysis: One approach is to simply remove any observations that have missing values. This approach is known as complete case analysis or listwise deletion. While this method is simple to implement, it may result in a loss of valuable data, especially if there are a large number of missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imputation: Another approach is to impute missing values with an estimate of their value. There are several methods of imputation, including mean imputation, median imputation, and regression imputation. Mean and median imputation involve replacing missing values with the mean or median of the observed values for that variable. Regression imputation involves using other predictor variables to estimate the missing value.\n",

    "Modeling Missingness: A third approach is to model the missingness of the data as a function of the observed data, and include the missingness model as an additional predictor variable in the Elastic Net Regression model.

    "Grid search CV is a powerful technique for hyperparameter tuning that helps us find the optimal set of hyperparameters for a given machine learning model. It works by creating a grid of all possible hyperparameter combinations and evaluating the model's performance on each combination using cross-validation. The set of hyperparameters that results in the highest cross-validation score is selected as the optimal set for the model."

    "Data leakage refers to the situation where information from the test set or future data is leaked into the training set or model building process, resulting in overly optimistic performance metrics and inaccurate model predictions. Data leakage can occur in several ways, such as including information from the test set in the training data, using information from the future to make predictions, or relying on features that will not be available at prediction time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data leakage is a problem in machine learning because it leads to overfitting and inaccurate predictions. The model may learn patterns that are not generalizable to new data, leading to poor performance on the test set or in the real world. In addition, data leakage can lead to false assumptions about the performance of the model, which can result in incorrect decisions being made based on the model's predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose a credit card company is trying to predict fraudulent transactions using machine learning. If the company includes the transaction date in the features used for training the model, it may inadvertently introduce data leakage. This is because the model may learn that fraudulent transactions tend to occur on certain dates, such as holidays or weekends, which may not be true in the future. This would lead to overfitting and inaccurate predictions when the model is used to make predictions on new data."

Similarly, if a model is making more false negative errors than false positive errors, it may indicate that the model is overly cautious or conservative in its predictions.
